# Challenge-2-Portfolio

##Description
The purpose of this project is to create a personal portfolio that represents me as a person, what I have accomplished as a web developer and to showcase my skills in a professional manner.
I will use what I have learned so far in HTML and CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing and interactive single page application to begin showcasing my knowledge as an aspiring web developer.
